<h2>Why Software Engineer</h2>
<p>
As an eight-year-old, I was utterly obsessed with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Quest_IV:_Chapters_of_the_Chosen">Dragon Quest IV: The Chapters of the Chosen</a>, the gaming classic in which I could live vicariously through different characters and assume such myriad roles as magician, warrior, priest, etc. The quest required the protagonist to build and lead a grand alliance of other characters in the game to take on and defeat Estark, the Ruler of Evil. I was so engrossed in the gameplay that I regularly went all day long without eating or sleeping, and in an attempt to pry into its inner workings, I even went so far as to snap in half a game cartridge. Though I was then patently unable to fathom the functions of the printed circuit board and chip set thus exposed, it was nonetheless the beginning of a beautiful relationship with the art of software engineering, one that has led me to first major in <a href="http://www.eecs.ntu.edu.tw/main.php?lang=en">Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the National Taiwan University (NTU)</a>.
</p>
<p>
Over the course of my career thus far, I have come to realize that, in many ways, leading a software engineering task force is not that much different from a quest in a game. Both require working well in a <b>team</b>, a meticulous attention to <b>details</b>, a sheer refusal to give up, no small amount of <b>ingenuity</b> and <b>creative problem solving</b>, and most importantly, <b>passion</b>.
</p>

<h2>Experiences</h2>
<p>
Immediately after graduating from NTU, I joined <a href="http://www.foxconn.com/">Foxconn</a>, the world's largest original design 
manufacturer, as a software engineer. I specialized in developing and maintaining BIOS and firmware source codes that enable seamless 
interfacing between software and hardware. In addition to mastering <b>assembly</b> language, I further acquired an in-depth understanding 
of how software and hardware work hand in hand with each other. Thereafter, to broaden my horizon, I joined the <a href=
"http://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/index_en.html">Institute of Information Science at Academia Sinica</a>, the preeminent research institution 
in all of Taiwan, and assiduously devoted myself to the comprehensive study of such topics as <b>networking</b>, <b>transport protocols</b>
, and packet flow data. My stint as a Research Assistant at Academia Sinica was exceedingly fruitful; in addition to mastering numerous 
coding techniques, I further published three papers, in two of which I appeared as the first author (see <a href="publications.html">
publications</a>).
</p>
<p>
After that, I joined in the Software Research and Development Department at <a href="http://www.asus.com/">ASUSTeK</a>, the world's leading motherboard manufacturer. Upon joining ASUSTeK, I was quickly put in charge of spearheading our efforts to design and develop software to seamlessly interface with and get the most out of our hardware. My <b>dedication</b>, drive and <b>exemplary performance</b> quickly saw me recognized with the highest scores in successive performance reviews and promotion to a manager within less than two years.
</p>
<p>
I work well whether by myself or as part of a team, and I am proud to say that each phase of my career has given me unique exposure and insights into the industry, thereby enabling me to bring diverse and often refreshing perspectives to the table. I am intimately familiar with the inner workings of firmware, hardware, and software, and their respective roles and interactions in yielding a fully functional package. Having worked both in the academia and the industry, I am further mindful of the gaping gap between academic pursuits and commercial products and the crucial steps to take to bridge the divide, especially in a fast-moving world that places such emphasis on speed and alacrity. 
</p>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>
I am majoring in the Master of Science in Information Networking at Carnegie Mellon University (<a href="http://www.ini.cmu.edu/degrees/msin/index.html">MSIN@CMU</a>), and will graduate in <b>December 2015</b>. The education at CMU teaches me to tackle future challenges and gives me a competitive edge over others and all the necessary skill sets to succeed as a technological innovator in the age of globalization. Studying and working in America will shape my international outlook and give me a keener appreciation of other corporate cultures. Therefore, I'm seeking a <b>summer internship</b> to utilize my skills and extensive previous experience in computer systems into industry application and technology development, and to gain invaluable practical experiences in the industry, preferably with a high-tech firm in the Silicon Valley.
